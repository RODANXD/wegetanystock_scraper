Now over a decade later we decided it was time for a little makeover of the classic. We lightened-up the flavour and adjusted the blend to create a taste that is better experienced than described. Of course our Monster Energy DNA remains unchanged. For our new paint job we called on longtime friend and legendary street artist Risk. His iconic west coast style and vibrant presentation perfectly captures the spirit of our original Khaos reborn as Khaotic!",
