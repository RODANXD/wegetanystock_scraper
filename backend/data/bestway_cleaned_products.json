Now over a decade later we decided it was time for a little makeover of the classic. We lightened-up the flavour and adjusted the blend to create a taste that is better experienced than described. Of course our Monster Energy DNA remains unchanged. For our new paint job we called on longtime friend and legendary street artist Risk. His iconic west coast style and vibrant presentation perfectly captures the spirit of our original Khaos reborn as Khaotic!",

It's our classic noodles in a chicken and mushroom flavour sauce with vegetables and a little sachet of soy sauce. Sounds delicious, right? Plus, it's dead easy to make and it only takes 4 minutes, so even if you aren't a master chef, you can make it. If you're hungry and looking for a quick, convenient and tasty solution, we've got the noodles for you. Stir it up! How to make it yourself? It's simple and quick. Rip off the lid. Whip out the sachet. Add boiling water to fill level and re-cover with the lid. Leave alone for 2 minutes, then give it a stir before leaving for another 2 minutes. Finally, give it another stir as you add the pot noodle flavour sachet and dig in! Make sure to seize your opportunity and strike while the pot's hot - do not reheat. Don't forget to recycle the packaging - the lid and pot are both recyclable. Both cleverly convenient and deviously delicious, our mushroom and chicken noodles have none of that artificial colour or preservative stuff and are suitable for vegetarians. Eat them up with NO worries. *Nielsen Retail Measurement Service for the Mini Meals - Pot snacks segment for the 52-week period ending 16/08/2022.",
